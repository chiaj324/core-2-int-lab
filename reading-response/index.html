		<h2>Week 3</h2>
		<h3>Response to: <span class="title">The Web's Grain</span> by <span class="author">Frank Chimero</span></h3>
		<p>
			&emsp; Chimero does an excellent job of breaking down the fundamentals of websites while pointing out the flaw in their
			modern execution. The way he compared the beginner's mind to the basic perspective of websites was a great help
			in explaining the issue to me. Websites are websites; a designer's desperation to make them uselessly complicated
			when they are supposed to simplify the user's experience is where modern web design has failed. I agreed with his 
			hopelessness when it came to the increase in technology leading to a decrease in thoughtful design, yet am more
			hopeful in regards to a comeback in the future. His explanation of the boundaries and standards of simplicity
			were very easy to understand and actually helped me think of websites as a stacked, tangible frame.

		<h2>Week 4</h2>
		<h3>Response to: <span class="title">Black Gooey Universe</span> by <span class="author">American Artist</span></h3>
		<p>
			&emsp; In the reading, we tackle the idea of whiteness in the tech industry and the way that black influence
			is constantly erased. They mention how tech spaces have simply become echo chambers for cishet white male designers.
			There are no repercussions in these spaces and they are allowed to speak with no contradiciton or evaluation of 
			what they are actually saying. The author ties a connection to the way that black, as a color, is the very 
			foundation of digital projection and how this is overlooked and being replaced with little regard for its importance.

		<h2>Week 5</h2>
		<h3>Response to: <span class="title">Function as Universe</span> by <span class="author">Weiyi Li</span></h3>
		<p>
			&emsp; Li talks about the story of function and its relation to the design of its form. They phrase function almost as 
			a journey, presenting a series of objects and examing their uses. They continue into the point of "form follows function",
			saying that its meaning has been severely changed by the evolution of technology. More advanced tech leads to a simpler form 
			that can perform all of the functions it needs. They acknowledge that designers will always create the form for the function
			of the objects, but they point out that this is a one-sided relationship where the objects may not be always used for that
			function when it comes to how the user uses it.

		<h2>Week 8</h2>
		<h3>Response to: <span class="title">Sharing as Survival: Mindy Seu on the Cyberfeminism Index</span> by 
			<span class="author">Marie Hoejlund and Mindy Seu</span></h3>
		<p>
			&emsp; The "Cyberfeminism Index" is a project created by Mindy Seu, which is an active spreadsheet
			for the trail of cyberfeminism that has been spread out across the internet. According to her, cyberfeminism
			is defined as on oxymoron of the hyper-sexualized "cyberbabes and fembots" that were popular during the peak of
			sci-fi media and the first major wave of technological advancement. Although cyberfeminism has a rich history
			with a significant impact on internet culture
