		<h2>Week 3</h2>
		<h3>Response to: <span class="title">The Web's Grain</span> by <span class="author">Frank Chimero</span></h3>
		<p>
			&emsp; Chimero does an excellent job of breaking down the fundamentals of websites while pointing out the flaw in their
			modern execution. The way he compared the beginner's mind to the basic perspective of websites was a great help
			in explaining the issue to me. Websites are websites; a designer's desperation to make them uselessly complicated
			when they are supposed to simplify the user's experience is where modern web design has failed. I agreed with his 
			hopelessness when it came to the increase in technology leading to a decrease in thoughtful design, yet am more
			hopeful in regards to a comeback in the future. His explanation of the boundaries and standards of simplicity
			were very easy to understand and actually helped me think of websites as a stacked, tangible frame.

		<h2>Week 4</h2>
		<h3>Response to: <span class="title">Black Gooey Universe</span> by <span class="author">American Artist</span></h3>
		<p>
			&emsp; In the reading, we tackle the idea of whiteness in the tech industry and the way that black influence
			is constantly erased. They mention how tech spaces have simply become echo chambers for cishet white male designers.
			There are no repercussions in these spaces and they are allowed to speak with no contradiciton or evaluation of 
			what they are actually saying. The author ties a connection to the way that black, as a color, is the very 
			foundation of digital projection and how this is overlooked and being replaced with little regard for its importance.
