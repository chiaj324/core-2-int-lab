    <main>
    <div class="columns">
    <section>
        Chemical names, bird names, names of fire
        and flight and snow, baby names, paint names,
        delicate names like bones in the body,
        Rumplestiltskin names that are always changing,
        names that no one’s ever able to figure out.
        Names of spells and names of hexes, names
        cursed quietly under the breath, or called out
        loudly to fill the yard, calling you inside again,
        calling you home. Nicknames and pet names
        and baroque French monikers, 
        written in
        shorthand, written in 
    </section>
    <section>
        longhand, scrawled
        illegibly in brown ink on the backs of yellowing
        photographs, or embossed on envelopes lined
        with gold. Names called out across the water,
        names I called you behind your back,
        sour and delicious, secret and unrepeatable,
        the names of flowers that open only once,
        shouted from balconies, shouted from rooftops,
        or muffled by pillows, or 
        whispered in sleep,
        or caught in the throat like a lump of meat.
        I try, I do. 
    </section>
    <section>
        I try and try. A happy ending?
        Sure enough — Hello darling, welcome home.
        I’ll call you darling, hold you tight. We are
        not traitors but the lights go out. It’s dark.
        Sweetheart, is that you? There are no tears,
        no pictures of him squarely. A seaside framed
        in glass, and boats, those little boats with
        sails aflutter, 
        shining lights upon the water,
        lights that splinter when they hit the pier.
        His voice on tape, his

        name on the envelope,
        the soft sound of a body falling off a bridge
        behind you, the body hardly even makes
        a sound. The waters of the dead, a clear road,
        every lover in the form of stars, the road
        blocked. All night I stretched my arms across
        him, rivers of blood, the dark woods, singing
        with all my skin and bone Please keep him safe.
        Let him lay his 
        head on my chest and we will be
        like sailors, swimming in the sound of it, dashed
        to pieces. Makes

        a cathedral, him pressing against
        me, his lips at my neck, and yes, I do believe
        his mouth is heaven, his kisses falling over me
        like stars. Names of heat and names of light,
        names of collision in the dark, on the side of the
        bus, in the bark of the tree, in ballpoint pen
        on jeans and hands and the backs of matchbooks
        that then get lost. Names like pain cries, names
        like tombstones, names forgotten and reinvented,
        names 
    </section>
    <section>
        forbidden or overused. Your name like
        a song I sing to myself, your name like a box
        where I keep my love, your name like a nest
        in the tree of love, your name like a boat in the
        sea of love — O now we’re in the sea of love!
        Your name like detergent in the washing machine.
        Your name like two X’s like 
        punched-in eyes,
        like a drunk cartoon passed out in the gutter,
        your name with two X’s to mark the spots,
        to hold the place, to keep the 
    </section>
    <section>
        treasure from
        becoming ever lost. I’m saying your name
        in the grocery store, I’m saying your name on
        the bridge at dawn. Your name like an animal
        covered with frost, your name like a music that’s
        been transposed, a suit of fur, a coat of mud,
        a kick in the pants, 
        a lungful of glass, the sails
        in wind and the slap of waves on the hull
        of a boat that’s sinking to the sound of mermaids
        singing songs of love, and the tug of a simple
    </section>
    <section>
        profound sadness when it sounds so far away.
        Here is a map with a your name 
        for a capital,
        here is an arrow to prove a point: we laugh
        and it pits the world against us, we laugh,
        and we’ve got nothing left to lose, and our hearts
        turn red, and the river 
        rises like a barn on fire.
        I came to tell you, we’ll swim in the water, we’ll
        swim like something sparkling underneath
        the waves. Our bodies shivering, and the sound
        of our 
    </section>
    <section>
        breathing, and the shore so far away.
        I’ll use my body like a ladder, climbing
        to the thing behind it, saying farewell to flesh,
        farewell to everything caught underfoot
        and flattened. Names of poisons, 
        names of handguns, names of places we’ve been
        together, names of people we’d be together,
        Names of endurance, names of devotion,
        street names and place names and all 
        the names of our dark 
    </section>
    <section>
        heaven crackling in their pan.
        It’s a bed of straw, darling. It sure as shit is.
        If there was one thing I could save from the fire,
        he said, the broken arms of the sycamore,
        the eucalyptus 
        still trying to climb out of the yard —
        your breath on my neck like a music that holds
        my hands down, kisses as they burn their way
        along my spine — or rain, our bodies wet,
        clothes clinging arm to elbow, clothes clinging
    </section>
    <section>
        nipple to groin — I’ll be right here. I’m waiting.
        Say hallelujah, say goodnight, say it over
        the canned music and your feet won’t stumble,
        his face getting 
        larger, the rest blurring
        on every side. And angels, about twelve angels,
        angels knocking on your head right now, hello
        hello, a flash in the sky, would you like to
        meet him there, in Heaven? Imagine a room,
        a sudden glow. Here is my 
    </section>
    <section>
        hand, my heart,
        my throat, my wrist. Here are the illuminated
        cities at the center of me, and here is the center
        of me, which is a lake, which is a well that we
        can drink from, but I can’t go through with it.
        I just don’t want to die anymore.
