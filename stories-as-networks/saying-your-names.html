        and flight and snow, baby <span class="names">names</span>, paint <span class="names">names</span>,
        delicate <span class="names">names</span> like bones in the body,
        Rumplestiltskin <span class="names">names</span> that are always changing,

        cursed quietly under the breath, or called out

        calling you home. Nick<span class="names">names</span> and pet <span class="names">names</span>

        longhand, scrawled
        illegibly in brown ink on the backs of yellowing
        photographs, or embossed on envelopes lined
        with gold. <span class="names">Names</span> called out across the water,
        <span class="names">names</span> I called you behind your back,
        sour and delicious, secret and unrepeatable,
        the <span class="names">names</span> of flowers that open only once,
        shouted from balconies, shouted from rooftops,
        or muffled by pillows, or 
        whispered in sleep,
        or caught in the throat like a lump of meat.
        I try, I do.

        I try and try. A happy ending?
        Sure enough — Hello darling, welcome home.
        I’ll call you darling, hold you tight. We are
        not traitors but the lights go out. It’s dark.
        Sweetheart, is that you? There are no tears,
        no pictures of him squarely. A seaside framed
        in glass, and boats, those little boats with
        sails aflutter, 
        shining lights upon the water,
        lights that splinter when they hit the pier.

        <span class="names">name</span> on the envelope,
        the soft sound of a body falling off a bridge
        behind you, the body hardly even makes
        a sound. The waters of the dead, a clear road,
        every lover in the form of stars, the road
        blocked. All night I stretched my arms across
        him, rivers of blood, the dark woods, singing
        with all my skin and bone Please keep him safe.
        Let him lay his 
        head on my chest and we will be
        like sailors, swimming in the sound of it, dashed
        to pieces. Makes

        a cathedral, him pressing against
        me, his lips at my neck, and yes, I do believe
        his mouth is heaven, his kisses falling over me
        like stars. <span class="names">Names</span> of heat and <span class="names">names</span> of light,
        <span class="names">names</span> of collision in the dark, on the side of the
        bus, in the bark of the tree, in ballpoint pen
        on jeans and hands and the backs of matchbooks
        that then get lost. <span class="names">Names</span> like pain cries, <span class="names">names</span>
        like tombstones, <span class="names">names</span> forgotten and reinvented,
        <span class="names">names</span>

        forbidden or overused. Your <span class="names">name</span> like
        a song I sing to myself, your <span class="names">name</span> like a box
        where I keep my love, your <span class="names">name</span> like a nest
        in the tree of love, your <span class="names">name</span> like a boat in the
        sea of love — O now we’re in the sea of love!
        Your <span class="names">name</span> like detergent in the washing machine.
        Your <span class="names">name</span> like two X’s like 
        punched-in eyes,
        like a drunk cartoon passed out in the gutter,
        your name with two X’s to mark the spots,
        to hold the place, to keep the

        treasure from
        becoming ever lost. I’m saying your <span class="names">name</span>
        in the grocery store, I’m saying your <span class="names">name</span> on
        the bridge at dawn. Your <span class="names">name</span> like an animal
        covered with frost, your <span class="names">name</span> like a music that’s
        been transposed, a suit of fur, a coat of mud,
        a kick in the pants, 
        a lungful of glass, the sails
        in wind and the slap of waves on the hull
        of a boat that’s sinking to the sound of mermaids
        singing songs of love, and the tug of a simple

        profound sadness when it sounds so far away.
        Here is a map with a your <span class="names">name</span>
        for a capital,
        here is an arrow to prove a point: we laugh
        and it pits the world against us, we laugh,
        and we’ve got nothing left to lose, and our hearts
        turn red, and the river 
        rises like a barn on fire.
        I came to tell you, we’ll swim in the water, we’ll
        swim like something sparkling underneath
        the waves. Our bodies shivering, and the sound
        of our 
    </section>

        breathing, and the shore so far away.
        I’ll use my body like a ladder, climbing
        to the thing behind it, saying farewell to flesh,
        farewell to everything caught underfoot
        and flattened. <span class="names">Names</span> of poisons, 
        <span class="names">names</span> of handguns, <span class="names">names</span> of places we’ve been
        together, <span class="names">names</span> of people we’d be together,
        <span class="names">Names</span> of endurance, <span class="names">names</span> of devotion,
        street <span class="names">names</span> and place <span class="names">names</span> and all 
        the <span class="names">names</span> of our dark

        heaven crackling in their pan.
        It’s a bed of straw, darling. It sure as shit is.
        If there was one thing I could save from the fire,
        he said, the broken arms of the sycamore,
        the eucalyptus 
        still trying to climb out of the yard —
        your breath on my neck like a music that holds
        my hands down, kisses as they burn their way
        along my spine — or rain, our bodies wet,
        clothes clinging arm to elbow, clothes clinging

        nipple to groin — I’ll be right here. I’m waiting.
        Say hallelujah, say goodnight, say it over
        the canned music and your feet won’t stumble,
        his face getting 
        larger, the rest blurring
        on every side. And angels, about twelve angels,
        angels knocking on your head right now, hello
        hello, a flash in the sky, would you like to
        meet him there, in Heaven? Imagine a room,
        a sudden glow. Here is my

        hand, my heart,
        my throat, my wrist. Here are the illuminated
        cities at the center of me, and here is the center
        of me, which is a lake, which is a well that we
        can drink from, but I can’t go through with it.
        I just don’t want to die anymore.
