            I want to tell you this story without having to confess anything,
            <br>
            without having to say that (<span class="secret"><span>I ran out into the street to prove something,
            <span class="right">that he didn't love me,</span>
            that I wanted to be thrown over, possessed.</span></span>)

            Max in the wrong clothes. Max at the party, drunk again.
            <br>
            Max in the kitchen, in refrigerator light, his hands around the neck of a beer.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="right"><i> Tell me we're dead and I'll love you even more</i></span>
            <br>
            I'm surprised that I say it with feeling.
            <br>
            <span class="right">There's a thing in my stomach about this. A simple thing. The last rung.</span>
