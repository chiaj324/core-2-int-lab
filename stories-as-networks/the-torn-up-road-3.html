            Can you see them there, by the side of the road,
            <br>
            <span class="right">not moving, not wrestling,</span>
            making a circle out of the space between the circles? Can you see them
            <br>
            pressed into the gravel, pressed into the dirt, pressing against each other
            <br>
            in an effort to make the minutes stop--
            <br>
            headlights shining in all directions, night spilling over them like
            <br>
            gasoline in all directions, and the dark blue over everything, and them
            <br>
            <span class="right">holding their breath--</span>
