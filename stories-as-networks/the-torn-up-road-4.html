            I want to tell you this story without having to say that (<span class="secret"><span>I ran out into the street
            <br>
            <span class="right">to prove something, that he chased after me</span>
            and threw me into the gravel.
            <br>
            And he knew it wasn't going to be okay, and he told me 
            <br>
            <span class="right">it wasn't going to be okay.</span>
            And he wouldn't kiss me, but he covered my body with his body 
            <br>
            and held me down until I promised not to run back out into the street again.</span></span>)
            <br>
            <br>
            But the minutes didn't stop. The prayer of nowhere
            <br>
            <span class="right">going nowhere.</span>
